## My process

Began with HTML to structure the layout of the card and the page. I then installed via cli, the Tailwind framework
and added the relevant styles. Pretty straightforward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Some CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The challenging part which I didn't encounter before was how to use two images on different screen sizes using Tailwind. After failing to find the solution I just used custom CSS properties. The other thing was Tailwind helped reduce excess CSS classes. In the beginning I had blotted my HTML with unnecessary classes but I trimmed it down in the debugging phase.

Another thing, I used to text-align: justify most of the time, but on this particular project, it threw off my designs and I found out that that particular CSS style adds spaces between words. So aligning to the left solved the issue. You can read more about my challenges in my blog here -> https://blog.mikenjuki.com/
